		Hey. Thanks for visiting me. So my name is Nuruddin
		and I am a first year undergraduate here at IIT Kharagpur.
		I am from the place called Bhavnagar in Gujarat,India.
		I have a patch of white hair on my head too which happened
		due to some disease. No fancy style or anything.
		I am 18 years of age and still haven't done much in life.
		And I am a master procrastinator.

<pre style="font-size:23;">
		So coming to things I like. I like reading stuff(mostly fantasy-fiction
		and stuff similar to it). And sleeping too. I like to do some coding too
		I guess(pretty basic though). I like gaming too but more on consoles
		like the PlayStation I have at home than PC gaming. And I like to
		watch movies too.

<pre style="font-size:23;">
		There are many things which I don't like about me too. List out the bad things
		too,eh. I have a very weird nature. I hardly talk. Due to that people think that
		I am arrogant or don't have much interest in them. That is not true at all. But I
		guess thats what I give on. Also I am a pushover. The biggest one there is.
